#compdef autocc

# zsh completion script for autocc (Corrected Version)
#
# To install:
# 1. Save this file as '_autocc' in ~/.zsh/completions/
# 2. Ensure fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath) is in your ~/.zshrc
# 3. Reload your shell (exec zsh)

# This is the function that _arguments will call to get the list of commands.
_autocc_cmds() {
    local -a commands

    # Define all available subcommands with their descriptions.
    commands=(
        'init:Prompts for configuration and creates a new build environment'
        'rescan:Clears the cache and performs a full dependency scan'
        'manual:Prompts for configuration but does NOT scan for dependencies'
        'clean:Removes the build directory and cache'
        'version:Show current version, build time and date'
        'help:Shows the help message'
    )

    # _describe is a helper to list completions with their descriptions.
    _describe -t commands "autocc commands" commands
}

# This is the main completion entry point.
_autocc() {
    # _arguments is the main Zsh completion helper function.
    # '1:: :->cmds' means:
    #   '1:'     - This rule applies to the first argument.
    #   ':'      - An optional argument name (we leave it empty).
    #   '->cmds' - If a completion is inserted, jump to the 'cmds' state.
    # The action part is now directly calling our function.
    _arguments \
        '1: :_call_function 1 _autocc_cmds' \
        '*:: :->args'
}

# It's good practice to call the main function at the end.
_autocc "$@"

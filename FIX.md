# FIXING 101
- [ ] Refactor the code to use explicit function for compiling instead of constructor overloading.
- [ ] Add proper toml config file parsing
- [ ] Expand the detection map for greater coverage.
- [ ] Rework commands as follows:
- autoconfig: asks the user for basic information (compilers, etc.), performs a deep scan for -I and -L, writes everything to config.
- setup: validate the presence of the config file, create build dir, cache dir, convert config to cache.
- sync: clone the old cache to somewhere else, convert new config to cache and invalidate the cloned one.
- compile: NOTE: the compile command ONLY uses cache, compile using cache.
- clean: remove objects, and targets
- wipe: remove anything related to autocc (except the config file-of course)
- [ ] Add checksums, or hashes rather than simple timestamp for incremental builds.
- [ ] Optimize, while being modular.
- [ ] Use modern C++ features, do not use any manual memory management, even better keep everything on the stack.
